##Death and DDT in *The Peregrine* (1967)###. 
When we see a dead animal, we often look away. The animal could be a family pet or deer
that got hit by a car and all we do is jerk our heads back to the road and try to forget the scene.
We do not acknowledge its life. All told, we do not think it matters. Some people go against this
manner of thinking. J.A. Baker the author of the novel, *The Peregrine*, is one of those people.
His novel forces the reader to stare at the death and to acknowledge that there was a living
breathing creature and now it’s dead. The death that Baker brings to the attention of the reader is
based on his actual observations. *The Peregrine* is the culmination of years of bird watching of
the peregrine falcon which in Baker’s time was being brutalized due to humanity's overreliance
on powerful pesticides that they did not completely understand. This perspective that Baker
gained allowed him to examine the death that was found around him. Baker's depiction of death
in The Peregrine* allows him to highlight the death that was sowed both directly and indirectly by
human hands, while also illustrating to the reader the death that would come due to DDT, at the
time of its publication.  
##J.A. Baker
J.A. Baker, the author of *The Peregrine*, was born in 1926 in Chelmsford, England which is
a small town in Essex, where he lived his entire life. He was born into a middle-class household
and as a result, he was never wanting materially as a child. This was not to say that his childhood
was a perfect one. Baker’s relationship with his father was not a good one. Throughout Baker’s
childhood his Father, Wilfred Baker, was strict and sometimes abusive to his mother, Pansy
Baker (Saunders, 2017, p. 35, p. 48). Both of these factors served to isolate Baker from his peers
because he did not have a suitable father figure that would have guided him through the bumps
of adolescence. Additionally, Baker’s Father looked down on those who enjoyed poetry and 
implied “that they were latent homosexuals” and when he found out his son enjoyed poetry and
had ambitions to become a writer, he leveled that scorn onto Baker (p. 51). This is significant
because Baker did not have the support of his father and though having his father being against
his dream could have bolstered his ambition, it still did not serve as a positive event in his life. If
his father had not been an obstacle in his path to become a writer they could have healed the
damage done earlier in his life. This reconciliation never occurred and the two were at each
other's throats well into Baker’s twenties (p. 51). By the time Baker was able to escape his
father's control the world was undergoing a cataclysmic upheaval.  
When Baker was a young adult World War II was raging on in Europe. The shadow that
was leftover Baker by the Second World War left him alienated from his peers. This was because
Baker was unable to join the military because of his poor eyesight (p. 57). Baker was isolated
with his male peers fighting in mainland Europe. Additionally, because of Germany's
indiscriminate use of the V-1 and V-2 Rockets, Baker was left with post-war fatigue which put
him in Roffey Park Rehabilitation Centre (p. 63). Both of these events left Baker isolated from
his peers and contributed to him viewing himself as a natural loner (p. 146). However, years later
Baker would not be looking into the sky to spot a missile seeking the death of his countrymen,
rather he would look to the sky in search of a peregrine diving towards its prey.  
<p>In the first part of *The Peregrine* Baker writes, “I came late to my love of birds” (Baker,
1967, p. 10). He first began to begin bird watching when he was in his late twenties when a
coworker introduced him to the hobby (Saunders, 2017, p. 90). And though his definition of late
could be debated this shows that Baker was not born looking at birds and instead he found his
passion after years of living. Bird watching is a solitary activity where an individual spends long
hours alone secluded from society. This lent itself well to Baker’s nature and bird watching
would help inspire his two novels, *The Peregrine* and The Hills of Summer. However Baker
could not indulge in his passion for long as he suffered from ankylosing spondylitis, a condition
which fuses the small bones of the back together (Saunders, 2017, p. 35). The slow but arduous
transition to immobility disallowed Baker from enjoying his hobby. It caused great pain to Baker
and its treatment eventually caused the cancer that he would die from (p. 144). 
##The 1967 Novel, *The Peregrine*
<p>Furthermore, *The Peregrine* by J.A. Baker is a piece of nature writing. To put it simply
nature writing is closely tied to environmental studies and not only “offers a wider range of
concrete information than is usually found in contemporary poetry and fiction but also displays
an unusual array of formal and stylistic innovations” (Elder, 2004). This is seen in *The Peregrine*
where it is written in such a way that it still retains its factual nature while still allowing for
embellishment to make the work more poetic. This is important because it allows Baker to give
the reader his impression of what was seen. Through his words, the reader can read what so
enthralled Baker about the bird and what he thought would be lost with their death.</p>
<p>The structure of *The Peregrine* is as such: The first part, “Beginnings” gives the reader the
objective of his work, to capture the essence of the peregrine because Baker thought it was too
late for them to survive (Baker, 1967, p. 15). In the second part, “Peregrines”, Baker tells the
reader the idiosyncratic oddities of the bird and their eating habits. And in the third and final part
of the novel, “The Hunting Life”, Baker captures the months of October to April in which the
narrator follows the peregrine all winter throughout the Essex countryside saying “[w]herever he
goes, this winter, I will follow him. I will share the fear, and the exaltation, and the boredom, of
the hunting life” (p. 41).</p>
<p>*The Peregrine* is a fictionalized memoir; however, this is not saying that *The Peregrine* was
completely fabricated, rather Baker condensed a decade of observations into one winter
(Saunders, 2017, p. 111). Additionally, the novel has no named characters. The narrator is hardly
present and has no interactions with humans. Baker also does not attempt to humanize the birds
that he describes. Instead, Baker allows the birds to be unmorphed, and true to their original
form. This stylistic choice by Baker allows the reader to get a sense of the beauty of the world
that is so often overlooked. It allows the reader to get a sense of the beauty of the world that was
being threatened by humankind's greed.</p>
<h2>Sociohistorical-context.</h2>
<p>Agriculture has long been subject to the whims of the natural world. A dust storm or
particularly dry growing season can cause farmers to lose entire harvests. Insects are similar and
are particularly destructive to farmers' livelihoods; however unlike a drought or dust storm, there
is a way to negate the damage done by insects. The solution? Pesticides. One such example is
DDT which was first used significantly as a pesticide in 1948 and was quickly adopted by the
agricultural industry (Farrier, 2014). DDT was beneficial to the agricultural industry because it
was a way that they could ensure harvest stability. However just under two decades later, in
1967, J.A. Baker would write “[m]any [peregrines] die on their backs, clutching insanely at the
sky in their last convulsions, withered and burnt away by the filthy, insidious pollen of farm
chemicals” (p. 15). The reason that Baker wrote this is that DDT was not only killing insects but
also poisoning the rest of the ecosystem. How it did so was that when small birds and rodents ate
the dead insects killed by DDT, they would also ingest the pesticide and from there the residue of
DDT from the poisoned insects would work its way through the food chain into larger and larger
animals.</p>
<p>The effects that DDT has on animals are devastating and the effects of DDT on the
peregrine population were especially potent. In Britain, it was found that in 1964 the breeding
population of the peregrines was 56% of their historical levels (White, 1984, p. 214). The
significance of that number cannot be understated. Some argued that DDT was the scapegoat for
the decline in the bird populations and that those arguments against DDT’s use “were more
emotional than accurate” (Diamond, 1963, p. 115). This argument is not backed up by intensive
studies that were done at around the same time which shows that the simultaneous drop in the
peregrine population around the world has four things in common. First, the decline of the
population shows a temporal correspondence with the use of pesticides after World War Two.
Second, where there is a heavy amount of pesticides in use, the peregrines are gone and the
opposite is true for locations where there are few pesticides in use, with a few exceptions. Third,
the disappearance of the adult peregrine population in a region is preceded by years of
reproductive abnormalities. And finally fourth, when the bodies of peregrine carcasses and eggs
were examined high levels of DDT residue were found (Cade, White, Haugh, 1968, p. 171).
These findings are significant because they disprove the argument that DDT and other pesticides
have no effect on the animal population. At the time of Baker writing his novel, *The Peregrine*,
there was debate over DDT and no policy action was being taken to address the death that it was
causing. Because of the lack of action being taken Baker sought to take whatever action he could
to make a difference.</p>
<p>Baker thought that the peregrine population was going to continue to shrink until the
species became extinct, writing, “[b]efore it is too late, I have tried to recapture the extraordinary
beauty of this bird” (1967, p. 15). This quote shows the thought process that Baker was
undergoing when writing his novel. But what did he want? He wanted to show the world the
beauty of this bird that he was enamored with. He wanted a snapshot of the species that he saw
as doomed. He wanted to cease the preventable destruction that was being wrought with
ever-increasing intensity every year that DDT was still in use. And, he wanted to be a piece of a
movement that sought to expose the dangers of human actions.</p>
<p>*The Peregrine* was released five years after *Silent Spring* by Rachel Carson which was
released in 1962. *Silent Spring* was the novel that rocketed DDT into the central focus of the
public's attention. Carson’s novel was one of the most influential novels in the debate over DDT
and it did so by dramatizing “problems that had occurred across the country and suggested our
future if we continued what she characterized as our reckless use of pesticides” (Dunlap, 2008, p.
92). This is important because it shows a keen difference between Carson’s and Baker’s
approach to covering the ecological disaster that was taking place. Carson was predicting the
future that the world could face if it did not change its course. Baker on the other hand was
showing what the world was already facing and that the damage was already being done</p>
<h2>Analysis of themes.</h2>
<p>Throughout *The Peregrine*, Baker describes a landscape where both life and death are
abundant. When the narrator in *The Peregrine* was searching for remains of birds that a peregrine
had killed he states:</p>
<p><sup>I walked along the sea-wall between marsh and water. Short-eared owls breathed
out of the grass, turning their overgrown, neglected faces, their yellow eyes’ globulin
glow. A green woodpecker flew ahead, looping from post to post, clinging like moss,
then sinking into heavy flight. The marsh echoed with the hoarse complaint of snipe. I
found six peregrine kills: two black-headed gulls, a redshank, and a lapwing, on the wall;
an oystercatcher and a grey plover on the single beach. (Baker, 1967, p. 76)</sup></p>
<p>This quote shows just how vibrant the Essex countryside was and it also shows that despite
that vibrancy death lingers, ever-present, and ever ready to claim its next victim. That death
could be brought about by a hunting peregrine like in the scene described in the quotation or the
death could also be brought about by human hands. In *The Peregrine*, Baker illustrates death as a
way to show the reader how death is wrought both directly and indirectly by humans while the
looming threat of DDT promised more death to come, at the time of the novel's publication.</p>
<p>In his novel, Baker examined death that was directly caused by humans. The
narrator when coming across a woodpigeon that had:</p>
<p><sup>Blood welled from its eye like a red tear, and spread over its face in a horrifying
lop-sided circle. The other eye stared out, impelling the bird round in the snow. It
clutched with its wings, half of its brain already dead. When I lifted it up, it still kept
turning, turning, like a toy train that is meaningless away from its rails. I killed it, threw it
down in the snow, and walked on. (Baker, 1967, p. 132)</sup></p>
<p>This quote is significant because it shows that even the narrator who is enamored with birds kills
one. It also shows how thoughtlessly the narrator did so too. Additionally, at the time of The
Peregrine’s publication, DDT was being widely debated but Baker was not just content at
critiquing our species’ use of DDT instead he wanted to bring more aspects to our actions to
light. He tried to show how it does not take a complex pesticide to cause death. Death can be
caused in many different ways and DDT was just one of the many ways humans can kill species.
Earlier in that same day, the narrator observed a group of people fire upon a flock of birds:</p>
<p><sup>Shots were fired, and many birds fell dead. The others roared into the sky. The white sky
became black as the black ground whitened. A mile away, the sound of wings was like an
aircraft taking off. At a hundred yards, it was unbelievably loud, a landslide of crashing
reverberant clangour engulfing the banging of guns and the shouts of men. In woods and
orchards there were thousands more of these desperate birds, and vast flocks flew over
the north and north-east, searching for and end to the whiteness below. They go down
before the guns, like the cavalry at Balaclava. (p. 127)</sup></p>
<p>This quote is significant because it describes the power humans have over birds. In this scene, it
only takes a few humans to end the lives of hundreds of avians. This death also shows the
selfishness of our species. The people did not fire off warning shots to scare off the birds,
instead, they shot to kill. By exposing how thoughtless these people’s actions were Baker showed
that DDT was not just a minor slip up on our evolutionary path but rather a continuation of the
trend of killing without consideration for the consequences. Baker did not only critique people
intentionally killing avians. He also critiqued how avians were being killed indirectly from our
species’ actions.</p>
<p>Throughout *The Peregrine*, Baker illustrates scenes where death was wrought by people.
Many times there was no human stepping on the necks of the dying creatures but because of
actions taken by humanity, the creatures died all the same. When there was a freeze the narrator
came across a dying kingfisher and described, “[n]ow it is slowly dying in the blind glare of the
snow. Soon it will be sepulchred in the ice it cannot pierce, crushed into frozen light below the
dark cave where it was born. A fungus of whiteness grows upon the eye, and spreads along the
nerves like pain” (p. 128). This quote might seem irrelevant at first because this kingfisher was
killed by the freeze. Humans cannot control the weather on command, at best we can predict it.
However because of the DDT contamination that was so interwoven in the environment at this
time the kingfisher was weakened. So, because of that weakness induced by DDT, the kingfisher
was at the point where a freeze finished it off. It was not just the kingfisher that died in this
fashion. Later on, Baker describes a scene where “[t]wo dead herons lay in the snow together,
like a pair of gaunt grey crutches; eyeless and tattered corpses, torn and shredded by many
shapes of tooth and beak and claw” (p. 131). This quote is significant because it shows the reader
that it was not a fluke that the kingfisher had died. Rather it is something more systemic that
underlies the deaths that this freeze caused. DDT is that something. Both of these excerpts from
the novel show the Baker illustrates how humanity needs to consider the effects of its actions.
Even if that action might seem like a good idea, like a chemical that could help the agriculture
sector boom, because that seemingly good idea could turn out to be a poison that will kill entire
species if left unchecked. Baker not only described the death that DDT was already causing but
also of the promise of the death that will be wrought in the future.</p>
<p>The promise of death is something that permeates Baker’s entire novel. When a peregrine
eats its prey it ingests DDT. Each and every time without fail it will continue to ingest DDT
whenever it feeds. With each growing season that DDT was in use, the contamination would get
worse and worse and the peregrines do not know it. Baker writes that young peregrines “[w]hile
the autumn ploughing lasts, they will follow the white-bannered tractors from field to field
across the valley. They seldom attack. They just like to watch” (Baker, 1967, p. 40). This quote
while at a simple glance may seem innocent. Though on closer inspection it is much more
insidious. The peregrines are curious and intrigued by farm equipment that serves the industry
that is killing them through its use of DDT. They do not know that they are being poisoned.
Instead, the birds were just watching. It is not just the birds and mammals that are being poised
either. Baker writes that a peregrine “caught and ate six worms” (Baker, 1967, p. 161). This
quote is significant because studies show that “[b]irds that fed on DDT-laced invertebrates had
intense exposures to DDT, and many were killed” (Freedman, 2014, 1265). The peregrine is
doing nothing wrong. It was doing nothing out of the ordinary and is just going about its daily
life. However, the bird has been contaminated with DDT. Everything that the peregrine eats is in
some way contaminated with DDT. The peregrine is going to die. There is no way around it. It is
going to die because of DDT. It may not die for months, it may not even die for years, but it will
inevitably die and when it does DDT will have played a part in it.</p>
<p>Through examination of the death in *The Peregrine*, Baker enables the reader to see the
death directly or indirectly caused by humans while also foreshadowing the death to come if
DDT would cease being used. The ecological landscape of Baker’s time was one fraught with
death due to the use of DDT. Baker by writing his novel sought to bring attention to this death
that he saw as preventable. The impact that he made may have not achieved his intended goal but
the legacy of his novel cannot be overstated.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>DDT eventually was banned from agricultural use throughout North America and a
significant portion of Europe in the early ’70s (Freedman, 2014, p. 1266). The DDT crisis ended
with humanity righting its wrongs and ultimately it saved the world from an ecological collapse.
However Baker’s work ultimately had little impact on that decision. *The Peregrine* though
having little influence over the decision to ban DDT was well regarded with the novel receiving
multiple accolades including the Yorkshire Post’s book of the year for best first work (Saunders,
2017, p. 116). However, despite that recognition, the novel never sparked a wider debate. A
reason for this could be that the novel did not offer anything new to the debate over DDT. It did
not give anyone new statistics or figures. The novel was also not controversial enough to gain the
attention of the pro-DDT camp. No matter the reason for *The Peregrine* having little impact on
the banning of DDT, Baker’s work still has had an important impact on our society due to his 
work inspiring later generations of nature writers who similarly have apocalyptic challenges to
address.</p>
<p>Baker’s work has had a significant impact on modern writers and has inspired them. Robert
Macfarlane, a currently working nature writer, writes in the introduction of *The Peregrine*, where
he says *The Peregrine* “is a book which sets the imagination aloft, and keeps it there for months
and years afterward” (2005, p. xv). This quote shows the reader that Macfarlane has been keenly
touched by Baker’s work. By saying, “years afterward” Macfarlane is telling the reader that he
has been enlightened by the work and that he felt the effects of that enlightenment for years (p.
xv). This is important because Macfarlane is not just writing to help people enjoy the natural
world but rather his writing serves the purpose of addressing the damage that is being done by
climate change. Macfarlane is not the only modern nature writer who has been influenced by
Baker. Kathleen Jamie through her engagement with Baker’s writings retains her “admiration for
his single-minded pursuit of his own decentering” (Farrier, 2015, p. 756). This is important
because Baker, through the pursuit of his vision, inspired two current nature writers whose work
seeks to expose the damage being done by the effects of climate change. This goes to show that
though Baker’s work did not have a profound impact on the DDT crisis its cause was not a lost
one. This is because Baker’s goal was not just to expose the effects DDT had on the avian
populations but also to show the reader the power humanity had over the world and if humanity
did not use this power wisely they could do irreparable damage to the natural world.</p>
<p>Baker’s impact on the DDT crisis was a small one but despite that small impact, his
influence on modern nature writers has had a much bigger impact. Though the impact strayed
from Baker’s intended impact for the novel which was to bring attention to the plight of the
peregrine. Having the biggest impact of his novel being that it inspired others to walk the same
path that Baker took does not conflict with that. Baker’s battle against DDT was won and now it
is up to the next generation to fight against the next challenge and *The Peregrine* offers them a
guide about how to go about that fight. There are plenty of challenges to be had. In India, the
vulture population has been decimated dropping from 40 million in the 1980s to a mere 15
thousand in 2015 (Rinde, 2019). Climate change is also an ever-present and ever-growing global
catastrophe and unlike DDT it will not be solved with a simple change in pesticides. Much more
work will be needed to combat the coming chain of disasters.</p>
<h2>Concusion</h2>
<p>In *The Peregrine*, Baker showcased the damage being wrought by man’s unsustainable
relationship with nature, which was done through the examination of death. Agriculture's
overreliance on and misuse of DDT had damaged the natural world to the point the peregrine’s
survival was unknown. Baker sought to educate the world about what it meant for a creature to
be dead. Which he did through his depiction of death Instead of shying away from the death, he
looked at ways that he could do something about the cause of that death and he took action. J.A.
Baker was not a scientist. What he could do though was write and he used that skill to be the
change he wanted. *The Peregrine* is what resulted. In the modern age of extinction, it is
important to not shy away from the death that is being caused by humanity's greed. Instead, our
species needs to look at what is happening and decide what it wants to do about it.</p>
